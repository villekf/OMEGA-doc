Features
========

(Almost) Full list of features for OMEGA v2.0.

.. note::

   MATLAB/GNU Octave/Python refers that the features under that are available for all three, while some are available only for MATLAB/Octave (MATLAB/GNU Octave only) or Python (Python only).
   Furthermore, all features listed under Any data are available for any data type, i.e. PET, CT, SPECT or any other data, while those under PET Features are for PET only, CT features only for CT, etc.
