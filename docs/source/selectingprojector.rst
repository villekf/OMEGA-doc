PET data
--------

For PET data, projector_type = 3 is the most optimal one, although also the slowest to compute. This is a volume of intersection based projector, where the voxels are approximated as spheres and the tube of intersection as a cylinder.
The user can determine the size of the sphere with ``options.voxel_radius``, where value of 1 means that the sphere is just large enough to fully contain the cubic voxel. Larger values have larger spheres, while smaller
lead to smaller spheres. The radius of the tube can be set with ``options.tube_radius``.

An alternative to the above, is projector_type = 2, which is an orthogonal distance-based ray-tracer. This is practically equal in speed with the above. It computes the orthogonal distance from the voxel where the ray is currently to the nearby voxels. If the distance is lower than
the threshold value, then the distance is included, otherwise it is omitted. You can adjust this distance with ``options.tube_width_xy`` in the XY-plane, i.e. 2D, and with ``options.tube_width_z`` in 3D. If ``options.tube_width_z`` is
set, then ``options.tube_width_xy`` is ignored. ``options.tube_width_z`` always operates in all three dimensions.

The fastest methods are projector_type = 1 or projector_type = 4. The first one computes the exact line of intersection length in each voxel using an improved version of the Siddon's algorithm. The latter is an interpolation-based
projector, similar to Joseph's method, i.e. it linearly interpolates values after a pre-determined step-size. This step-size can be adjusted with ``options.dL`` and is the relative size of one voxel. I.e. ``options.dL = 1``
would use the length of one voxel as the interpolation length. Multi-ray version is also available, though recommended only for projector_type = 1. The number of transaxial rays can be adjusted with ``options.n_rays_transaxial`` and 
axial with ``options.n_rays_axial``. While projector_types 1 and 4 are the fastest, they produce lower quality images than projector types 2 and 3. However, you can compensate for this somewhat by using point spread function (PSF) blurring. This can be enabled
by setting ``options.use_psf`` to true. The FWHM can be adjusted with ``options.FWHM`` and must include value for all three dimensions. Note that projector type 4 is OpenCL/CUDA only! This means that only implementations 2, 3 and 5 
support it (note that Python uses only implementation 2!).

Note that you can also use hybrid methods if you wish, such as ``projector_type = 13``, but these are not recommended with PET data. The first value corresponds to the forward projection (1 in this case) and the second to the
backprojection (3 in this case).

Projector types 5 and 6 and their hybrids are NOT supported with PET data!

PSF modeling
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As already mentioned above, PSF blurring/modeling can be enabled by setting ``options.use_psf`` to true. This uses a shift-invariant Gaussian blurring with the FWHM values taken from ``options.FWHM``. Each dimension should have
its own FWHM value (in mm), but the values can be identical. The PSF is thus identical along the ray and only potentially varies along a specific dimension, although even then the variation is always constant. The PSF is applied in both 
forward and backward projection cases. It is also applied to custom reconstruction cases calling the projector operators, if selected.

CT data
-------

All optimal CT projectors are OpenCL/CUDA only! This means that only implementations 2, 3 and 5 support them and the CPU version of implementation 2 does not!

For CT data, generally the most optimal choice is the branchless distance-driven (BDD) projector, i.e. projector_type = 5. However, this method is slow and can be practically useless in certain cases (depending on the scanner geometry). 
It has reduced usefulness when using regularization. BDD is the branchless version of the distance-driven projector. In general, the DD methods compute the area of the intersection. For forward projection, we project rays from the 
source to the four corners of a detector pixel. The area inside these four points in the image volume is then computed for each slice. Backprojection works similarly, but we project the lines to the corners of each voxel and then 
compute the area on the detector. In general, the backprojection tends to have a greater beneficial effect compared to the other projectors than the forward projection. See below for hybrid projectors.

Projector type 4 is a method that should work in most cases well. It is ray-based interpolation-based projector in the forward projection and voxel-based projector in the backprojection. The forward projection is identical with the
PET version, i.e. it linearly interpolates values after a pre-determined step-size. This step-size can be adjusted with ``options.dL`` and is the relative size of one voxel. I.e. ``options.dL = 1``
would use the length of one voxel as the interpolation length. The backprojection projects rays from the source through each voxel to the detector and then interpolates this value on the detector using nearest-neighbor interpolation. 
This projector is not exactly adjoint, but the difference is generally less than 1%. Using longer interpolation length leads to faster computation, but too large values lead to loss of accuracy. Generally, value of 0.5 or 1 is
a good choice. An alternative method to projector type 4 is type 1, which computes the exact intersection length of each ray with each voxel. Note, however, that this should always be combined with other backprojector! See the hybrid methods below. 
This is a faster forward projector than type 4 if ``options.dL = 0.5`` or smaller, but slower if ``options.dL = 1`` or higher. Type 4 can have faster convergence than type 1 (i.e. same number of iterations can lead to noisier image with type 4), 
but in general there shouldn't be significant quality differences (note that this applies only to hybrid cases!). Use of type 1 on its own, i.e. as ``options.projector_type = 1`` is NOT recommended!

Projector types 2 and 3 are not recommended for CT data, but they work with implementation 4, i.e. they support CPU reconstruction outside of OpenCL (as does projector type 1). Projector type 1 also works with implementation 1, if you need the actual 
system matrix, see :doc:`reconstruction`.

Hybrid projectors can be a good choice for CT data. For example ``projector_type = 14`` is a method where the forward projection uses an improved version of the Siddon's ray-tracer as outlined above. 
Alternatively, the BDD can be combined with either, e.g. ``projector_type = 45``. Note that generally it is not recommended to use hybrid projectors where BDD is the forward projector, such as ``projector_type = 54``.
A good combination of quality and speed is to use ``projector_type = 45``, or ``projector_type = 15``. 

SPECT data
----------

For SPECT, currently only projector types 1, 2, and 6 are supported. Projector type 1 is a ray-based projector algorithmically identical to the PET version, i.e. the exact intersection length between a voxel and the ray is computed and 
converted to probability. The pattern of the rays traced is similar for all detector pixels and can be selected either arbitrarily or from a cone determined by the collimator geometry. This serves as an approximation for the collimator 
cone of response in the case that the collimator holes are not aligning with the detector pixels. However, practical tests have shown that this approximation has a minimal effect on the image quality. Projector type 6, on the other hand, is a 
rotation-based projector where the image is rotated and then reconstructed as a parallel beam case with a point spread function.

The Siddon ray tracing projector is usable for any parallel hole or pinhole collimator. Any other type of collimator such as converging or diverging hole, requires additional detector coordinate and/or sinogram manipulation. Orthogonal distance ray tracer and the rotate-and-sum projector support only parallel-hole collimators.

Other data
----------

Projector type 1 is recommended. It is the most robust and flexible method and should work in all voxel-based ray-tracing cases. Projector type 3 might also work, but this depends on the data. See PET data above for details 
on projector type 3. Type 4 should also be applicable to all cases, but, as mentioned above, only works in OpenCL/CUDA environment.

If your data is similar to that of CT data  (i.e. individual projections on a flat panel), then using CT projectors should be fine. In such a case, see the CT data above.
